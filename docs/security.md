## Supported Versions

We prioritize the latest stable release of WLAN Pi OS and associated packages for security updates and patches.

Previous versions may not receive security updates, and we encourage everyone to keep their systems up to date by upgrading to the latest version.

Responsible disclosure helps us maintain the security and integrity of WLAN Pi and its ecosystem
