## Submitting a pull request

Generically, this is the process you'll follow.

0. Fork and clone the repository you want to contribut to
0. Configure and install the dependencies
0. Make sure the tests pass on your machine (if the repository has tests)
0. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name` (fix/short_bug_desc or feature/widget)
0. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass (if the repository has tests)
0. Push to your fork and submit a pull request
0. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

## Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
