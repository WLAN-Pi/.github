## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

This project is all about providing a multi-purpose Wi-Fi analysis tool built on top of single-board computers and open-source software. We're building the software for WLAN Pi on GitHub to track code with version control, automate software deployment, accept contributions from others, socialize the project, and more! Many wonderful folks across the Wi-Fi industry and professional Wi-Fi communities are a part of and contribute to this project.
