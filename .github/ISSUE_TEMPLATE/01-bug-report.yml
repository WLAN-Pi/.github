        ## Please help us help you!

        Thank you for taking the time to fill out this bug report!

        **The GitHub issue tracker is not a support forum**. If you are not sure whether the issue could be your mistakes, ask in the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/WLAN-Pi/feedback/discussions) first. The quickest way to verify whether it's a WLAN Pi problem is through **reproduction**.

        Make the bug obvious. Ideally, we should be able to understand the issue without running any code.
