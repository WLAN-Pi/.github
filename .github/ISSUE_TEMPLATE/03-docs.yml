        This template is used for documentation requests, including:

        - Documenting undocumented feature functionality
        - Elaborating or expanding on a topic
        - Updating linkrot
        - Updating usage examples
        - Anything that doesn't include modifying code

        If you followed documentation but something still doesn't work, consider if the docs are wrong or the code is wrong. If the latter, use the bug report template instead.

        If your docs update or request is:

        - Relevant to a significant number of WLAN Pi users
        - Not about external tools or packages not supported by WLAN PI
        - Not documented elsewhere or easily discoverable

        We will very likely accept and merge a related pull request. Go a head and make the pull request.

        If you are not able to make the contribution yourself, we welcome the issue.
